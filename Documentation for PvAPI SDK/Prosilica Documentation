A guide on how to install the Prosilica GigE PvAPI SDK

You're running Ubuntu so download:
http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/fileadmin/content/PDF/Software/Prosilica_software/Prosilica_SDK/AVT_GigE_SDK_Linux.tgz

cd into the directory you downloaded it and untar it with:
tar xvf AVT_GigE_SDK_Linux.tgz

Next, download wxGTK >= 2.6 from:
http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

cd into the directory you downloaded it and untar with:
tar xvf wxGTK-2.8.12.tar.gz

cd into the wxGTK-2.8.12 folder you untar'ed and enter in Terminal
mkdir static
cd static
../configure --enable-shared=no --enable-shatic=yes --enable-unicode=yes --prefix=$PWD
make

cd out of the wxGTK and cd into the AVT GigE SDK directory

cd examples
nano ARCH

change:
CC = g++-{CVER}
into
CC = g++

control+o to write, control+x to quit. 

cd into the SampleViewer folder

nano Makefile

change the WX_DIR to the location of the static folder in wxGTK-2.8.12

same deal, write and exit

type 
make sample 
and it should make a working executable called SampleViewer. type
make install
and it should move the file into ../../bin-pc/x64
