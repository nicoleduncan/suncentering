Notes on making mock fiducial plane:

f = 25e-3
pix_size = 3.75e-6 * (.914-f)/f
; print,pix_size*1000

; .26mm for 2 pixels thick

; how long?
; 3: .399 mm
; 7: .933
; 9: 1.2
; 11: 1.46
; 15: 2

; how many pixels in our image editing program?

; @ 300 pix/cm
; 3: 12
; 7: 28
; 9: 36
; 11: 43.8
; 15: 60

; so we want our fiducials to be, say, .26x.4mm
