run emboss az =0 and az-180, ABS(A-B)

->find fid centers for CF, at what point is it too bad <-

image border check can be > 1 pixel, 6 pixels instead that we should care about in addition to 6 more (if sticking with range - mode(tmpcrop)

does program break if fiducials on edge? if not, that's fine

make doc of 3 fiducials I looked at and why -30 is good (and quantify it better) (and extend to 2 more fiducials (recrop))

define how close to edge we throw out fiducial detection

use binary mask centering maybe?

find centers first then think about quentionability

how many can we cut off and be ok?

irregular grid?

inquire about video from which our image is a freeze frame of

if fid is good, THEN do binary mask center of it! Won't have to worry about edge stuff then
