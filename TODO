# run emboss az =0 and az-180, ABS(A-B)

# ->find fid centers for CF, at what point is it too bad <-
	does program break if fiducials on edge? if not, that's fine
	how many can we cut off and be ok?
	find centers first then think about questionability
	define how close to edge before we throw out fiducials

image border check can be > 1 pixel, 6 pixels instead that we should care about in addition to 6 more (if sticking with range - mode(tmpcrop)

make doc of 3 fiducials I looked at and why -30 is good (and quantify it better) (and extend to 2 more fiducials (recrop))

use binary mask centering maybe?

irregular grid?

inquire about video from which our image is a freeze frame of

if fid is good, THEN do binary mask center of it! Won't have to worry about edge stuff then
