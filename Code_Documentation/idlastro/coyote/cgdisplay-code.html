<span class="comments">;        Changes so that color variables don't change type. 23 Nov 2010. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;        Moved the window index argument to the WID keyword. 9 Dec 2010. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;        Modified to produce a window in PostScript and the Z-buffer, too. 15 Dec 2010. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;        Added the FREE keyword. 3 January 2011. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;        I made a change that allows you to call cgDisplay inside a program that is</span>
<span class="comments">;           going to be added to a cgWindow. The program will not open a graphics window</span>
<span class="comments">;           if the current graphics window ID is found in a list of cgWindow window IDs.</span>
<span class="comments">;           It is now possible to use cgDisplay in any graphics program, even those that</span>
<span class="comments">;           will be run in cgWindow. 17 Nov 2011. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;        Added ASPECT keyword. 18 Nov 2011. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;        Allowed the window ASPECT to be set with an image argument. 25 Nov 2011. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;        Now use Scope_Level to always create a display when cgDisplay is called from</span>
<span class="comments">;           the main IDL level. 7 Feb 2012. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;        Added FORCE and MATCH keywords. 16 Feb 2012. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;        Added PIXMAP, RETAIN, TITLE, XPOS, YPOS, and LOCATION keywords. 4 Sept 2012. DWF.</span>
