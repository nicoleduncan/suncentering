<span class="comments">;       windowIndexNumber:   The window index number of the window you wish to</span>

<span class="comments">;</span>
<span class="comments">; NOTES:</span>
<span class="comments">;</span>
<span class="comments">;       The window vector obtained from the DEVICE command is not always the same length. It</span>
<span class="comments">;       is normally (on my machine) 65 elements long, but can be much longer if you have lots</span>
<span class="comments">;       of IDL windows open (by calling cgPickColorName, for example). But if no windows with </span>
<span class="comments">;       index numbers greater than 65 are open, IDL shinks the larger vector to the smaller one</span>
<span class="comments">;       as part of its housekeeping operations, which means it happens on their timetable, not yours.</span>
<span class="comments">;       This can result in the user having "stale" index numbers greater than 65, but no larger vector</span>
<span class="comments">;       to check them against. I have modified the code to return a 0 in this case, assuming that</span>
<span class="comments">;       whatever window your index number points to is long gone. I have not experience any ill effects</span>
<span class="comments">;       by doing this, but I STRONGLY advice you to ALWAYS know what window you are drawing into</span>
<span class="comments">;       when you issue a graphics command.</span>
<span class="comments">;</span>
<span class="comments">; MODIFICATION HISTORY:</span>
<span class="comments">;</span>
<span class="comments">;       Written by David W. Fanning, June 2005.</span>
<span class="comments">;       Modified to return 0 if the window index number is larger than the number of elements</span>
<span class="comments">;             in the WINDOW_STATE array. 25 June 2008. DWF.</span>
