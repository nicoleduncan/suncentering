<span class="comments">;   Provides a device-independent way to set the color decomposition state of the</span>
<span class="comments">;   current graphics device. Devices that do not have a DECOMPOSED keyword to the</span>
<span class="comments">;   DEVICE command are assumed to be in indexed color mode always.</span>
<span class="comments">;   </span>
<span class="comments">;   I have removed the Z-graphics buffer from being controlled by this program. I</span>
<span class="comments">;   do so reluctantly, but I am pragmatic enough to realize that progress forward</span>
<span class="comments">;   is necessarily slow and that I must recognize the reality of legacy IDL code.</span>
<span class="comments">;   </span>
<span class="comments">;   My personal view is that all graphics routines should use 24-bit decomposed</span>
<span class="comments">;   color. There are myriad advantages, but basically they boil down to this:</span>
<span class="comments">;   (1) You have 16.7 million colors available to you simultaneously, and (2) you</span>
<span class="comments">;   don't have to contaminate color tables to use drawing colors. Coyote Graphics</span>
<span class="comments">;   routines are in the habit of switching out of whatever color mode the user happens </span>
<span class="comments">;   to be using, into 24-bit decomposed color mode, then switching back when finished</span>
<span class="comments">;   with its business. But, it is impossible to do this correctly in the Z-graphics</span>
<span class="comments">;   buffer.</span>
<span class="comments">;   </span>
<span class="comments">;   The reason for this is that in the Z-graphics buffer, you need to switch not only</span>
<span class="comments">;   the color mode, but also the pixel depth. In other words, I would prefer to set</span>
<span class="comments">;   the Z-graphics buffer up like this::</span>
<span class="comments">;   </span>
<span class="comments">;       Set_Plot, 'Z'</span>
<span class="comments">;       Device, Decomposed=1, Set_Pixel_Depth=24</span>
<span class="comments">;       </span>
<span class="comments">;   But, if I do that, then I need to set it back (for 99 people out of a 100) like this::</span>
<span class="comments">;   </span>
<span class="comments">;       Device, Decomposed=0, Set_Pixel_Depth=8</span>
<span class="comments">;       </span>
<span class="comments">;   Unfortunately, using this command will erase whatever is in the Z-graphics buffer!</span>
<span class="comments">;   </span>
<span class="comments">;   My solution to this problem is to leave it to the user to configure the Z-graphics buffer</span>
<span class="comments">;   the way they want it. If you configure it to use 24-bit decomposed color, all of the Coyote</span>
<span class="comments">;   Graphics routines will work as they normally do. If you configure it to use 8-bit indexed color,</span>
<span class="comments">;   which is the default configuration, then it will work "normally", but you will be in great</span>
<span class="comments">;   danger of contaminating the system color table. The reason for this is that Coyote Graphics</span>
<span class="comments">;   cannot "restore" the entry color table in the Z-buffer without obliterating what is already</span>
<span class="comments">;   in the graphics window. Users who work with indexed color are probably already very much</span>
<span class="comments">;   aware of this problem, so it shouldn't surprise them. (They might not expect this with</span>
<span class="comments">;   Coyote Graphics, but this is the price that has to be paid.)</span>
<span class="comments">;   </span>
<span class="comments">;   My suggestion is to put the Z-graphics configuration in your IDL startup file. Set it</span>
<span class="comments">;   up in 24-bit decomposed color mode, use Coyote Graphics to do all your graphical output,</span>
<span class="comments">;   and you will find things working perfectly. </span>

<span class="comments">;         to set the current graphics device to indexed color. Devices lacking a </span>
<span class="comments">;         DECOMPOSED keyword are assumed to be perpetually in indexed color mode.</span>
<span class="comments">;         The Z-graphics buffer is always unchanged after the 24 Dec 2011 update. </span>

<span class="comments">;         The current decomposition state of the current graphics device when the</span>

<span class="comments">;     depth: out, optional, type=integer</span>
<span class="comments">;         The currnet pixel depth of the graphics device. </span>
