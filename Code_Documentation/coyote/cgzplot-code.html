<span class="comments">;  Operating Instructions--</span>
<span class="comments">;  </span>
<span class="comments">;  Use the LEFT mouse button to zoom the plot and the RIGHT mouse button to pan the plot.</span>
<span class="comments">;  </span>
<span class="comments">;  If you click and drag inside the plot axes, you will create a rubber band box. Select the</span>
<span class="comments">;  portion of data you wish to zoom into. The zoom will occur in both the X and Y directions.</span>
<span class="comments">;  If you wish to zoom the plot all the way back out, simply click and release the LEFT mouse</span>
<span class="comments">;  button inside the plot axes without moving the mouse.</span>
<span class="comments">;  </span>
<span class="comments">;  Once you are zoomed into a plot, you can adjust the zoom by clicking the LEFT mouse button</span>
<span class="comments">;  outside the plot axes. If you click the mouse below the plot, you will cause the X axis to</span>
<span class="comments">;  zoom out of the plot by the zoomFactor amount (normally 5% of the current range of the axis).</span>
<span class="comments">;  If you wish to zoom the X axis into the plot, simply click above in the region of the window</span>
<span class="comments">;  above the plot. Click below the plot to zoom out, above the plot to zoom in. Similarly, you </span>
<span class="comments">;  can adjust the zoom on the Y axis. Clicking to the left of the plot zooms the Y axis out, </span>
<span class="comments">;  while clicking to the right of the plot zooms the Y axis in.</span>
<span class="comments">;  </span>
<span class="comments">;  If you are zoomed into the plot, you can pan to different locations in the plot by using</span>
<span class="comments">;  the RIGHT mouse button. Hold and drag the RIGHT mouse button inside the plot axes. The</span>
<span class="comments">;  entire plot will pan in both the X and Y directions.</span>
<span class="comments">;  </span>
<span class="comments">;  File output requires that ImageMagick and GhostScript be installed on your machine. Note</span>
<span class="comments">;  that exact axis scaling is always in effect.</span>

<span class="comments">; :Params:</span>

<span class="comments">;         of the plot and is written in hardware fonts. Use of the label keyword</span>
<span class="comments">;         will suppress the plot title.</span>
<span class="comments">;    legends: in, optional, type=object</span>
<span class="comments">;         A single cgLegendItem object, or an array of cgLegendItem objects that will be</span>

<span class="comments">;         The default value is 0.05 or five percent of the current axis range on each</span>
