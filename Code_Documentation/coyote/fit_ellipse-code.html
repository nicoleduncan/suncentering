<span class="comments">;</span>
<span class="comments">;       Written by David W. Fanning, April 2002. Based on algorithms provided by Craig Markwardt</span>
<span class="comments">;            and Wayne Landsman in his TVEllipse program.</span>
<span class="comments">;       Added SCALE keyword and modified the algorithm to use memory more efficiently.</span>
<span class="comments">;            I no longer have to make huge arrays. The arrays are only as big as the blob</span>
<span class="comments">;            being fitted. 17 AUG 2008. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;       Fixed small typo that caused blobs of indices with a longer X axis than Y axis</span>
<span class="comments">;            to misrepresent the center of the ellipse. 23 February 2009.</span>
