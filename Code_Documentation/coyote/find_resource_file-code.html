<span class="comments">;  This function is designed to search for and return the fully qualified</span>

<span class="comments">;</span>
<span class="comments">;    1. In the current directory.</span>
<span class="comments">;    2. In the same directory as this file is found in.</span>
<span class="comments">;    3. In the directories rooted at the IDL resource directory (IDL_DIR/resource).</span>
<span class="comments">;    4. In the directories rooted at a resource directory found in the same directory this file is in.</span>
<span class="comments">;    5. In the directories rooted at a resource directory found in the a directory one above the directory this file is in.</span>
<span class="comments">;    6. Anywhere in the IDL PATH. Note that a *.pro file *must* be in a directory for the directory to be on</span>

<span class="comments">;</span>
<span class="comments">;  Written by: David W Fanning, December 12, 2008.</span>
<span class="comments">;  It seems all my resource files are in "resources" directories, not  "resource" directories.</span>
<span class="comments">;     So now the program looks in both places. 6 January 2009.</span>
<span class="comments">;  The file did not seem to be looking in the IDL path. It does now. 21 April 2010. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;  The file will also look in the directory of the caller of this program. 21 April 2010. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;  Fixed a problem when File_Search finds several files with the same name. Always takes the</span>
<span class="comments">;      first file found now. 4 June 2010. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;  Modified to look in the current directory first. 5 March 2013. DWF.</span>
