<span class="comments">; The purpose of this program is to return the normalized position coordinates for </span>
<span class="comments">; a line plot, contour plot, or image plot with a specific "layout" in the current</span>
<span class="comments">; graphics window. A "layout" has a specified grid of columns and rows organized </span>
<span class="comments">; inside a graphics display window. This is similar to the positions calculated by </span>
<span class="comments">; !P.Multi, although a great deal more flexible. Of course, with additional flexibility </span>
<span class="comments">; and power comes more responsibility. You will be required to use the NoErase keyword</span>
<span class="comments">; correctly and you will be responsible for setting the character size on your plots.</span>
<span class="comments">; These jobs are normally handled by !P.Multi. Some users will find this liberating, some </span>
<span class="comments">; will find it a pain in the keister. There is always !P.Multi to go back to.</span>
<span class="comments">; </span>
<span class="comments">; A grid position is a combination of the number of columns and rows desired, plus</span>
<span class="comments">; the application of inside and outside margins, as well as a desired aspect ratio.</span>
<span class="comments">; Margins are specified in units of one-third the !D.X_PX_CM value to be device independent. </span>
<span class="comments">; The outside margins locate the grid inside the graphics display window.</span>
<span class="comments">; (These are equivalent to !X.OMargin and !Y.OMargin system variable when displaying</span>
<span class="comments">; a grid with !P.Multi, for example.) Inside margins use the same units, but are</span>
<span class="comments">; used to modify the initial grid positions in the window. (These are equivalent</span>
<span class="comments">; to using the XMargin and YMargin keywords on a plot command.) For example, inside margins</span>
<span class="comments">; might be used to leave room inside a larger position for color bars or other annotations</span>
<span class="comments">; you wish to put on a graphics display. The aspect ratio modifies the grid position</span>
<span class="comments">; after the outside and inside margins have been applied to create the final grid position,</span>
<span class="comments">; which will be centered in its initial grid position.</span>
