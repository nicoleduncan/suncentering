<span class="comments">; PURPOSE:</span>
<span class="comments">;</span>
<span class="comments">;   The purpose of this function is to resolve object methods in files that have the object</span>
<span class="comments">;   methods in the same file as the object class definition module (i.e., object__define.pro).</span>
<span class="comments">;   It is particularly useful in restoring object methods for objects that have been saved and</span>
<span class="comments">;   are being restored. Restored objects often do not know about their methods unless an object</span>
<span class="comments">;   of the same object class has been previously compiled in that IDL session.</span>
