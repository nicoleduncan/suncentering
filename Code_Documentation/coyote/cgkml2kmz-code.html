<span class="comments">;   This program simply collects files created from the cgImage2KML program and moves</span>
<span class="comments">;   the files to a zip file with a *.kmz file extention. The method used is an</span>
<span class="comments">;   undocumented and unsupported method for creating KMZ files in IDL 8. It should not</span>
<span class="comments">;   be relied upon, and it will not work in earlier versions of IDL. The cross-platform </span>
<span class="comments">;   zip file functionality is scheduled to be exposed to IDL users in an IDL release </span>
