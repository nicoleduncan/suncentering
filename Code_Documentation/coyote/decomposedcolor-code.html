<span class="comments">; PURPOSE:</span>
<span class="comments">;</span>
<span class="comments">;   This function is used to determine, in a device independent way, if the </span>
<span class="comments">;   current graphics device is using color decomposition. The function returns</span>
<span class="comments">;   a 1 if color decomposition is turned on, and a 0 if it is turned off. When</span>
<span class="comments">;   color decomposition is turned on, we say the device is using a true-color</span>
<span class="comments">;   display. If color decomposition is turned off, we say the device is using</span>
<span class="comments">;   an indexed color display.</span>

<span class="comments">;</span>
<span class="comments">;  Written by: David W. Fanning, May 24, 2009.</span>
<span class="comments">;  Modified the way decomposition was obtained for PostScript devices IDL 7.1 and higher. 12 Dec 2010. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;  Fixed a problem in the CASE statement with ELSE clause and added a NULL device segment. 4 Jan 2011. DWF.</span>
<span class="comments">;  It now appears 24-bit PostScript support was added in IDL 7.1, although the Get_Decomposed keyword</span>
<span class="comments">;      didn't work until IDL 7.1.1. 13 January 2011. DWF</span>
