What is the most up to date documentation?

Do not be fooled by the "Last Edited" field, I decided it would be a good idea to recompile all the tex files at some point so those dates all got rewritten

The most up to date documentation is wwwdwwd.tex 

sum_to_find_fids is up to date in terms of explaining how we use 1D sums to find fiducials and not any of the other options mentioned.

slatfit is up to date only because there really hasn't been too much work on it

flen won't be out of date because we'll need it later to make a fake fiducial plane

ffind isn't out of date because I haven't really written code for it yet, more like a doc for a proof of concept

Quick explanation of why these files are out of date:

runthis: missing centroidwholesuns and how we use fiducial positions to smartly crop chords
skimage: still using the original small, blurry image from Gordon (although it does bring up the appealing option of using sort() for thresholds)
program_list: I don't use half those functions anymore
multisuncentroid: Incomplete flow chart, also this documentation was designed thinking we will have less than 3 suns to work with
jun25: using the 1D sum test to find fiducials on the original blurry image, maybe it's not out of date, but it's not quite up to date either
howbadisbad: no longer use edge-detection filters for fiducials
horizsum: no real work done after first week, guess it's both up to and out of date
grainysun: obsolete flow chart, code is also slow
gord_expl: parameter table has been updated, border checking has changed, final structure has also changed
final_doc_draft: abandoned 60% the way through, focused on wwdwwd instead. obsolete parameter table, border checking, and flow chart
fid_outline: basically all the steps leading up to 1D sums so it's really old
dgafwhichsuns: brings up how we find multiple suns and their thresholds in case we have partials. also forces us to know our constraints so we don't mix up brightnesses of suns
bunch_of_fid_edges: Uses edge-detection for fiducial finding
albertnotes: Back when I was comparing how to find fidcials to albert's cross-correlation method
