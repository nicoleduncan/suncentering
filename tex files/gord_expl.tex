\section{Thresholding Image} % (fold)
\label{sec:thresholding_image}

After we read in the necessary parameters, we turn our attention to thresholding the image to find the centers of the suns. Starting with the initial image, we sort the image according to pixel values and see a grouping of differently dimmed suns. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{../plots_tables_images/sortedarray.eps}    
    \caption{We look at the second derivative because it consistently quantifies the thresholds to identify each solar region by. With the right-most part of the 2nd derivative zeroed out, we identify the three peaks corresponding to what pixel value we should threshold by to separately identify each sun.}
    \label{sortedarray}
\end{figure}

Using these three thresholds, we create separate masks, one for each sun.

\subsection{Quick mask centering} % (fold)
\label{sub:quick_mask_centering}

	Now that we have three cropped regions, we have to identify what brightnesses they are. We do this by looking at a low enough threshold that all the solar pixels for every brightness are included in the mask but not any of the background pixels. We then use IDL's \hl{\texttt{LABEL\_REGION}} to assign a label number to each shape. A shape is defined to be a mask where there are adjacent pixels. If done correctly, we end up with 3 shapes that have now had their values replaced with what index they have been assigned. For this image, we have three regions, one a mask of 1s, one a mask of 2s, and one of 3s. Now we use \hl{\texttt{HISTOGRAM}} to bin these shapes and thus their locations. For each mask, we calculate the average value of the pixels from the starting image and  






	We find the centers of each cropped region in Figure \ref{triplecrop} using a simple masking method. With the centroid determined by a simple masking method, we have to make sure that the center is from a whole sun. The process so far has not taken into account any spatial information so the next step is to look at a border region of the mask. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\ffigbox{
    \begin{subfloatrow}
        \ffigbox[\FBwidth]% Width of subfloat
        {
        \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{../plots_tables_images/cutcorner.eps}
        }
        {
        \subcaption{What our mask should look like - side of black triangle is 1/4 of image width}
        \label{noborder}
        }
    \end{subfloatrow}
    \begin{subfloatrow}
        \ffigbox[\FBwidth]% Width of subfloat
        {
        \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{../plots_tables_images/cutcornerwborder.eps}
        }
        {
        \subcaption{A proposed mask that looks within a certain distance form the border.}
        \label{aborder}
        }
    \end{subfloatrow}
}
{\caption{The bottom corners will never see any data; the border mask takes into account the distance from the hypotenuse of the bottom corners}
\label{cuttingcorners}
}
\end{figure}


If the center we computed with the mask method is within a certain distance to the edge of the image (as shown in Figure \ref{aborder}), we mark that solar region as ``\emph{partial}'' and cease further analysis for that particular brightness sun. \\
\indent Once we have our list of whole suns along with their masked centers, we proceed to fitting the solar limbs to find a more accurate center.
% subsection quick_mask_centering (end)

\section{Limb Fitting} % (fold)
\label{sec:limb_fitting}

We cut 5 chords centered around the masked center position in both axes (See Figure \ref{chords}). With the same threshold found in \S \ref{sec:thresholding_image}, we look at where the chord profile crosses the threshold (See Figure \ref{limbs}). We use a four-pixel limb profile with 2 pixels above the threshold and 2 pixels below the threshold. We then do a linear fit on these four pixels to see where it crosses the threshold. With a pair of limb-fitted threshold crossing points, we create a chord and find it's center. Doing this 5 times, we average the positions of the chord centers to be the limb-fitted center position. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\ffigbox{
    \begin{subfloatrow}
        \ffigbox[\FBwidth-2.0cm]% Width of subfloat
        {

        }
        {
        \subcaption{The middle chord passes through the center of the sun}

        }
        {
        \subcaption{The indices in red are the pixels we apply a linear fit to see where it crosses the threshold (which is the horizontal line).}
        \label{limbs}
        }
    \end{subfloatrow}
}
{\caption{}
\label{sup}}
\end{figure}

% section limb_fitting (end)

\section{Finding Fiduials} % (fold)
\label{sec:finding_fiduials}

Now with limb-fitted centers, we re-crop the image to work with (It shouldn't look much different than Figure \ref{triplecrop} if we masked the centers correctly).

\subsection{First 1D Sum} % (fold)
\label{sub:first_1d_sum}

To find fiducials, we calculate a 1D sum in one direction and look for dips in the array corresponding to fiducials. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\ffigbox{
    \begin{subfloatrow}
        \ffigbox[\FBwidth]% Width of subfloat
        {
        \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{../plots_tables_images/smooth_expl.eps}
        }
        {
        \subcaption{This is the 1D sum of a solar image. The line in red is the sum smoothed by 10 pixels.}
        \label{doublelines}
        }
    \end{subfloatrow}
    \begin{subfloatrow}
        \ffigbox[\FBwidth]% Width of subfloat
        {
        \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{../plots_tables_images/smoothcomp.eps}
        }
        {
        \subcaption{We subtract the smoothed profile from the raw data to emphasize dips. Comparisons of the smooth amount change the width and number of the dips, although not really the depth. It says ``Red'' in the title, but it's really blue. Typo.}
        \label{threshed}
        }   
    \end{subfloatrow}
}
{
\caption{}
\label{smoothed}
}
\end{figure}

After thresholding the difference of the 1D sum from it's smoothed counterpart, we identify the column/row positions of fiducials. 
% subsection first_1d_sum (end)

\subsection{Ruling Out False Fiducial} % (fold)
\label{sub:ruling_out_false_fiducial}

With a bunch of x and y locations of fiducials, we have to determine which pairs of coordinates are actually fiducials. The first step is to look at each possible pair and eliminate those that are too bright. This affects candidates which are located on the solar disk but do not lie on fiducials. See Figure \ref{rulingout}.


\begin{figure}[!ht]
\ffigbox{
    \begin{subfloatrow}
        \ffigbox[\FBwidth]% Width of subfloat
        {
        \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{../plots_tables_images/allfid.eps}
        }
        {
        \subcaption{All possible positions of fiducials according to first 1D sum and matching up column/row positions.}
        }
    \end{subfloatrow}
    \begin{subfloatrow}
        \ffigbox[\FBwidth]% Width of subfloat
        {
        \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{../plots_tables_images/dimenough.eps}
        }
        {
        \subcaption{Ruling out values above a certain threshold}
        }
    \end{subfloatrow}
}
{
\caption{}
\label{rulingout}
}
\end{figure}


Next, for the remaining candidates, we look at the 1D row and column sums to see if there are any obvious dips. Figure \ref{goodfid} is a fiducial candidate with obvious dips in the row/column arrays. Figure \ref{badfid} on the other hand, has a distinctive shape for 1D sums and does not have any obvious dips. Using another thresholding technique, we smooth the 1D sum and look for peaks in the difference of the smoothed 1D sum minus the 1D sum. If there are any pixels above this secondary 1D sum threshold, then the fiducial candidate is considered a bona-fide fiducial.

\subsection{Sub-pixel Fiducial Positions} % (fold)
\label{sub:sub_pixel_fiducial_positions}

Now that we have a column/row position of a fiducial, we look to find a sub-pixel location of the fiducial. Now, this technique has proven to be more efficient in past iterations of the program and is still under construction.\\
\indent In earlier versions of the program, we used a 2D convolution filter with a kernel that looks like a fiducial. Areas on the image that look like fiducials have high correlation values and thus peak in the 2D convolved array. Once we had computed the local maxima (which gave us rough fiducial positions), we used 2 1D parabolic fitting procedures to the peak of the local maxima. The location where the two parabolas intersect (since they're perpendicular to each other) is the sub-pixel parabolic fit for the fiducial position.\\
\indent In this version of the code, we don't have any natural peaks in the 2D image so we have to look for peaks elsewhere. Thankfully, we have peaks in the 1D sums. Instead of using a parabolic fit to the 2D convolution of the image, we fit a parabola to the peak of the 1D sum. Same deal, we look where the two parabolas intersect. I'm honestly not sure if I can do this but for now this is how we're doing it.\\
\indent After thresholding the peak of the fiducial candidate's 1D sum, we end up with Figure \ref{fiddone}.

\section{Final Words} % (fold)
\label{sec:final_words}

Table \ref{structtable} is an example of how the final data structure is kept. Since the number of fiducials cannot be predetermined and I don't know how to append structure elements within a nested structure, the fiducial positions are kept in a separate pointer structure which takes the form of Table \ref{fidtable}. The structure of the \hl{\texttt{FIDARR}} array is shown in Table \ref{fidposarr}.
