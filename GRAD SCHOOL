GRAD SCHOOL


What do I want to do with my career?
What am I interested in? 

These are the types of questions that I've got to figure out before I apply to grad school. 

University of Arizona:
Sounds like it has strengths in INFRARED and TELESCOPES (optical and surveying). They have access to lots of ground based telescopes.

CU Boulder:
Looks like it doesn't have any strengths in particular, but it has programs in solar physics as well as observational astronomy and instrumentation, things I am interested in.

UCSD:
Looks very interesting as well. Looks like I'll have to email each of these programs and see if they'll accept people with below-average GPAs. 

Texas A&M:
Quote: "Observational Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology, specifically high redshift galaxies, resolved stellar populations, supernovae, and Antarctic telescopes."

Indiana University: http://www.astro.indiana.edu/faculty.shtml
Looks interesting, in particular, Eileen D. Friel, Catherine "Caty"  A. Pilachowski, Stuart L. Mufson

University of Wisconsin-Madison: http://www.astro.wisc.edu/our-science/research-areas/
This place has a lot of interesting research, definitely something to keep an eye on.

SUNY Stony Brook University: http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/astro/research.html
Mostly cosmology and observational astronomy with a smidgen of nuclear and computational astrophysics
